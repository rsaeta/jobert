InstaDeep, founded in 2014, is a pioneering AI company at the forefront of innovation. With strategic offices in major cities worldwide, including London, Paris, Berlin, Tunis, Lagos, Cape Town, Boston, and San Francisco, InstaDeep collaborates with giants like Google DeepMind and prestigious educational institutions like MIT, Stanford, Oxford, UCL, and Imperial College London. We are a Google Cloud Partner and a select NVIDIA Elite Service Delivery Partner. We have been listed among notable players in AI, fast-growing companies, and Europe's 1000 fastest-growing companies in 2022 by Statista and the Financial Times. Our recent acquisition by BioNTech has further solidified our commitment to leading the industry.

Join us to be a part of the AI revolution!

In the BioAI department, we advance the boundaries of healthcare and medical science through a combination of biology and artificial intelligence expertise. We are expanding a portfolio of successful initiatives across drug discovery, design, and protein engineering. Notably, we are developing the next-generation vaccines and biopharmaceuticals for cancer treatment and prevention and therapy of infectious diseases. By joining us, you will contribute to this effort in collaboration with scientists, engineers and biologists from both InstaDeep and BioNTech and have the opportunity to contribute to scientific papers submitted to leading conferences and journals.

Specifically, we work on the following research directions, and apply them at high scale in active production applications.

RNA Science: We are pushing forward the state of the art in optimisation of RNA for multiple characteristics including expression and half life in media and in cell. We are developing advanced methods of RNA characterisation and prediction of secondary and tertiary structure.

DNA Science: We are developing models of DNA chemistry to predict characteristics such as folding, binding energy and melting temperatures. We apply these models in areas such as biomolecule synthesis optimisation.

Immunogenicity: We are building models to understand the mechanisms of immunogenicity in order to design personalised immunotherapies.

Protein Folding: We are designing, utilising and improving the state-of-the-art protein folding models (e.g. AlphaFold 2, RFDiffusion, etc.) to investigate protein structural conformation and its distribution. These folding models are being used to understand protein functionalities, estimate protein stability, and study protein mutations and structural changes.

Protein Design: We are leveraging structural modelling, protein language models, protein folding models and quality-diversity methods to perform protein design with experimental feedback from wet labs.

Protein-protein Interactions: We are developing predictive models, based on molecular dynamic simulations and protein folding models, to study protein-protein interactions, dissociation kinetics, binding affinity enhancements and immune response activation.

Infectious Disease Modelling: We are actively monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 using structural modelling, DNA/protein language models, and protein folding models, with a direct impact on epidemiological studies and vaccine developments.

To support and extend the research capabilities of the BioAI department, the ML Software engineer will join a multifunctional team to build and enhance the next generation of protein folding platform.

Responsabilities

Participate in the planning, design and development of a scalable and robust protein folding application on the basis of state-of-the-art deep learning models such as AlphaFold 2.
